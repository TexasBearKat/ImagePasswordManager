creation:
    1. makes an array of pixel values to the height and width of the image provided
    2. salts the array based off of your key (puts fake data) (not functional)
    3. turns the values into image

decoding:
    1. takes the image and turns it into an array
    2. unsalts it using your key to find where the salt is (not functional)
    3. totals all of the rgb values
    4. converts to hexadecimal
    5. your key is either added or subtracted depending on index (letters wrap around to hex values if they are q or further)
